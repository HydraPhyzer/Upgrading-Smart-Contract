### Upgradig Smart Contracts

In This Section We Will Learn How to Upgrade Smart Contracts.

### Remembers Points ðŸ’¡

- Upgrading Smart Contract Does Not Compromise The Immutability of Smart Contract in Blockchain

- In This Chapter We Will Be Using `@openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades` Package For Upgrading our Smart COntract

- When We Initially Deploy Contarct, It Deploy Three Contracts in Real.

  - Implementation Contract (Our Original)
  - ProxyAdmin Contract
  - Proxy Contarct

  We Deal With Proxy Contarct For Calling Our Specified Methods

- When We Deploy a Contarct Using `deployProxy` Method, That Contract Instance Can Be Upgraded Later

- Only The Address That Originally Deployed Has the Rights to Upgrade

- On Upgrading, The State Values (Vairables) and Contarct Adress etc Remains Same as The Previous One

### Necessary Packages ðŸ“¦

```js
    npm install @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers
    npm install @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle
    npm install @openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades
    npm install ethereum-waffle
    npm install ethers
    npm install hardhat
```

And Dont Forget to Add Below Lines in hardhat.config.js

```js
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle");
require("@openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades");
```

### Procedure ðŸ§ª

```js
npm init -y
npm i hardhat
npx hardhat
```

Open Terminal and Run

`npx hardhat node` to Run Hardhat Local Blockchain

Now Deploy Our Contarc to Localhost

```js
npx hardhat run Scripts/DeployOld.js --network localhost`
```

Now Copy The Address of This Deployed Smart Contract

Now Open Terminal and Type

```js
npx hardhat console --network localhost

const A1=await ethers.getContarctFactory("Old")
const A2=await A1.attach("0x9AB3SHDJD .... ") //Contract Address
(await A2.Get()).toString() // Will Print Value of Num (1)

// Now Deploy Our New Contract
npx hardhat run Scripts/DeployNew.js --network localhost

//Now Run Again
const B1=await ethers.getContarctFactory("New")
const B2=await B1.attach("0x9AB3SHDJD .... ") //Contract Address
(await B2.Increment())
(await A2.Get()).toString() // Will Print Value of Num (2)

```
